CruiseProtocolScripts
=====================

Game Scripts which works with CruiseControl.

HOWTO
================

Compile BaalDL/CruiserControl project and put builded files into this folder,
then execute CruiserConsole.exe.

About .CPS file
================
.cps(Cruise Protocol Scripts) file format is packed lua script format.

A single .cps file may have one or more .cps function block, which starts by #function [functionname],
and ends with #end. inside the block is lua scripts with few functions defined in c#.

TODO
================
What I want to do is to complete a game, ultimately.

By 'a game', I mean one enjoyable status of game, not completed and fixed,
so that everyone who want to develop fun further can add contents and gameplay freely.

To complete the game, I have a brief roadmap:

1. Make battle <<< Now we're here.
2. Make dungeon search and encounter.
3. Gameplay iteration like play cycle, growing, items.
4. Story and quest and misc gameplay.
5. ......so that everyone can & want to add new contents to this game.

NOTE
================

Lauguage used for this game is Korean, for now.
[3] key doesn't works for now.
Unused codes not cleaned.
